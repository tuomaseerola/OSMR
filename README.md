# README

This repository offers a guide to Open Science practices for music research, particularly aimed for music psychology and computational musicology, but also relevant for music information retrieval, music education, music technology, and musicology. 

The public-facing version of the repository is **currently** available at
[https://tuomaseerola.github.io/OSMR/](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/OSMR/) but when the project is launched, it will be hosted an non-personal site.

## Reasons for creating this resource

In music research, there is room for improvement in _transparency_ and _reproducibility_, to widen the _accessibility_ and _equity_ with Open access to publications and data ensures that researchers, practitioners, and the public can benefit from scientific knowledge. Also, _innovation_ and _collaboration_ benefits from Open Science. A good teaching material dedicated to music research is missing at the moment and this repo attempts to fill this gap.

## The way this repository has been coordinated

This is a collaborative enterprise, using GitHub repository, where various authors are responsible for specific sections, see also [Chapter 2](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/OSMR/preface.html).
