# Preface {.unnumbered, .unlisted, #sec-preface}

In music research, particularly for music psychology and computational musicology, we should have a repository of information about _Open Science_ and its all areas (open access publication, open data, open code, registration, and replication). Some of this information has been put together for journal articles [@moss2021fair;@jensenius2021best], but having a centralised starting point for this would be helpful for training and awareness.

The repository of information can be best done with collaborative writing and compiling the resources together. 

## Plan and schedule

- Co-authors contacted and established (`February 2026`)
- Online repository coordinated at GitHub, potentially released at a dedicated domain address (not at [https://tuomaseerola.github.io](https://tuomaseerola.github.io))
- Early drafts ready (`November 2026`)
- Release (`February 2027`)
- Potential for a spin-off article and a hardcopy discussed (`Spring 2027`)

### Writing

- Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide first.

- Using markdown text, including markdown references, e.g. `[@moss2021fair]` linked to `references.bib` file, and utilising within document links `@sec-background`. All implemented via [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents at [GitHub](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/OSMR) to compile site/book as needed.

- Tracking the progress and issues via GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/issues/).

- Authorship order to be determined based on contribution and made transparent with [Contributor Taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org).
