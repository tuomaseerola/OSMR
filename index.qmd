# Open Science for Music Research

This repository offers a guide to Open Science practices for music research, particularly aimed for music psychology and computational musicology, but also relevant for music information retrieval, music education, music technology, and musicology. 

## Reasons for creating this resource

In music research, there is room for improvement in _transparency_ and _reproducibility_, to widen the _accessibility_ and _equity_ with Open access to publications and data ensures that researchers, practitioners, and the public can benefit from scientific knowledge. Also, _innovation_ and _collaboration_ benefits from Open Science. A good teaching material dedicated to music research is missing at the moment and this repo attempts to fill this gap.

## The way this repository has been coordinated

This is a collaborative enterprise, using GitHub repository, where various authors are responsible for specific sections, see also @sec-preface.
