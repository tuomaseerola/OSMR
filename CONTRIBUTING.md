# How to contribute

We use the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/) for all project activities, including [Issues](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/issues), [Milestones](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/milestones), [Topics](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/issues/1), and resources.

## What to contribute

Each contributor can choose a topic area and coordinate with others in the project to collaborate on that topic. If the current structure (see [Topic allocation](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/issues/1)) does not cover all relevant topics, new ones can be proposed.

The default assumption is that one person acts as the primary author for a topic area, but multiple authors are welcome. Please nominate yourself for topics of interest using the [Topic allocation](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/issues/1) tracker.

## Submitting changes

Please submit a [GitHub Pull Request to OSMR](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/pull/new/master) with a clear description of what you have done (see more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear commit message. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but larger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit

Revised the definition of the open access documents."
```

## Writing conventions

We use [APA standards](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines) for writing and references. Citations and references should be produced in Quarto using standard Pandoc citations. For example, `[@moss2021fair]` generates an in-text citation for Moss and Neuwirth (2021) and adds the reference to the [References](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/OSMR/references.html) section when the project is rendered.

See the Quarto guidebook for [citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html). Please add the BibTeX entry for any cited work to the [references.bib](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/OSMR/blob/main/references.bib) file.

Where possible, include links to relevant online guides on Open Science.

## Target audience

The aim is a concise and accessible guide for newcomers, as well as for researchers who are not yet familiar with open research practices but want to learn more. Think of postgraduate students, some undergraduates, and collaborators who are not yet fully engaged with open research.

## Graphics

You may wish to illustrate processes with figures. Once draft figures have been created within each topic area, we may redraw them using a shared style or template for consistency.
